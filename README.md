## I'm not reading anything else until you tell me how to use it

I figured as much. I know this doc is long, please at least take a moment and scroll to [disclaimers](#disclaimers)
before continuing, though.

### Option 1 (recommended): Run from a release

Download the latest release from the "releases" link above (or
[right here](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/releases)). Use your favorite md5 tool to verify what you
downloaded is legitimate.

![Selecting the correct download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/master/.readme_data/readme_1.png)

Note that you may have to tell Windows Defender to allow MTGA Tracker to run, as MTGA Tracker is currently
unsigned (did you know that code-signing keys & certs cost over $100 per year?)
Your antivirus will likely also want to scan it the first few times you run it.
See more in the [Signing section](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker#signing-code) below.

![Getting past windows defender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/master/.readme_data/readme_2.png)

### OR, Option 2: Run from source

_This option is not required or recommended unless you intend to contribute code changes to MTGATracker_

Make sure you have all of the following installed:
- [python3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [node.js / npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- (optional, but recommended) [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Note that if you choose to skip Git Bash, you're on your own w.r.t. formatting shell commands.

1. Open Git Bash
1. Make sure python is installed by typing: `python --version` . You should see:
    ```bash
    you@yourmachine MINGW64 ~
    $ python --version
    Python 3.6.4
    ```
1. Make sure npm is installed by typing: `npm --version` .  You should see:
    ```bash
    you@yourmachine MINGW64 ~
    $ npm --version
    5.6.0
    ```
1. Run these commands
    ```bash
    cd /c/path/where/you/want/the/code
    git clone https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker.git
    cd mtga-tracker
    # next 4 lines """optional"""
    python -m ensurepip
    pip install virtualenv --user
    python -m virtualenv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    # read more about virtualenv here: http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-python-virtualenv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd electron
    # tell npm to use python2.7 for node-gyp
    npm config set python python2.7
    npm install .
    ```
1. If all went well, you should now be able to:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    And the decktracker UI should launch!
    
    Note: check out debug flags, which can be set via command line
    [main.js](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/blob/master/electron/main.js#L222)
    
### FAQ

**Something with the tracker isn't working for me! What do I do?**

Check out our troubleshooting guide [here](https://github.com/mtgatracker/mtgatracker/wiki/Troubleshooting). If
nothing in here helps, please send us a message in the #troubleshooting channel on Discord with the following template:

> Help! My tracker is `<short description of issue>`.
> 
> Here's a screenshot of my tracker in debug mode:
>
> `<insert a screenshot of MTGATracker in debug mode, including the debug output in the console on the right side>`
>

**Something with Inspector isn't working for me! What do I do?**

Please message Spencatro#6059 on Discord **privately** with the following template:

> Help! Inspector is `<short description of issue>`.
>
> I signed in to Inspector using `<discord or twitch>`, and my username is `<twitch or discord username>`.
> My MTGA username is `<your username, case sensitive>`.
> The first 8 digits of my trackerID is `<the first 8 digits of your tracker key, located in
tracker settings under "Inspector">`.

**Why doesn't MTGATracker properly handle sideboarding in Competitive Draft (etc)?**

This is actually an issue with WotC's logging. There is no way for us to determine what happens during sideboarding 
based on what is written to the log. We've filed the following bug report with WotC and will be ecstatic to fix our 
stuff once they resolve it:

> Bug report: I tried to replace my entire deck with my sideboard during a competitive draft event, but something went wrong!
>
> OK, nothing actually went wrong, but the point of this bug report is that based on the log, there is no way to tell what happened with the sideboard anyways! The log doesn't properly record sideboard events.
>
> It looks like the client is attempting to tell the server that... something happened with sideboarding with this log message:

### Building

Building from windows? Try `sh build.sh` from git bash. If that doesn't work, get in touch with @shawkinsl to figure it
out. There's an open issue to improve this process--help us get CI/CD set up? See
[contributing](https://github.com/mtgatracker/mtgatracker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) ;)

Output will end up in `MTGATracker-<os>-<arch>` .

Building is probably not supported on OSX yet. (But then again, neither is MTGA, so what are you even doing?)

### Native App
**Backend**

The back end is at it's core a python log parser project. There's a websockets app tacked on top to communicate state
with the frontend.

**Front end**

The front end of MTGA Tracker is an electron app that uses node / websocket to communicate with the backend

### Project layout

`app` - python backend for watching MTGA logs

`electron` - native electron app

`scripts` - various scripts and utilities. either one-time use, or just don't really fit anywhere

`webtasks` - node.js / webtask.io code for webapp and app to talk to

`docs` - code for mtga-tracker.com (called docs for github pages)

### Signing code

Currently MTGATracker ~~is self-signed.~~ (Edit: since this doesn't do anything, we won't bother until
we get a real cert. Did you know that code-signing certs cost over $100 a year?! We didn't.)
So MTGATracker will likely go unsigned for now.
 
Regardless, under the guidance of this [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/84847/how-do-i-create-a-self-signed-certificate-for-code-signing-on-windows),
use the following commands to self-sign binaries (not really that useful, but good practice in case MTGATracker ever
does get a real cert).

```powershell
# generate a pfx certificate
PS C:\Users\Spencatro> $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName mtgatracker.com -Type CodeSigning -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My
PS C:\Users\Spencatro> $CertPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "my_passowrd" -Force â€“AsPlainText
PS C:\Users\Spencatro> Export-PfxCertificate -Cert "cert:\CurrentUser\My\$($cert.Thumbprint)" -FilePath "c:\t.pfx" -Password $CertPassword

# use windows SDK to sign with the certificate
PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64> ./signtool.exe sign /v /f C:\Users\Spencatro\t.pfx /t http://timestamp.comodoca.com/authenticode /p my_password C:\Users\Spencatro\PycharmProjects\mtga-tools\MTGATracker-win32-x64\MTGATracker.exe
The following certificate was selected:

## Disclaimers

Use MTGA Tracker at your own risk.
